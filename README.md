## Introduction

This is an analysis of a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. This is a free-to-play game, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items while playing it. This analysis is to find out the meanings behind the purchasing data.

## Instruction

In this analysis, the following folder contains the *raw data* and the *Jupyter notebook*:

[HeroesOfPymoli](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/python-challenge/tree/main/PyBank)



Inside the folder, two useful files are included:
- **HeroesOfPymoli_analysis.ipynb** 
    - This is the file that contains the main script to run the analysis.
- **Resources** folder
    - This folder contains the CSV file (raw data).

## Conclusion (Observable Trends)

1. Majority of the game players are male players, and almost half of the players' ages are between 20 and 24 years old. As a result, we can assume that the game will likely do well if it keeps the target players as **male college students**.

2. Although male players makes up the most of the player population, female players and other/non-disclosed gender players actually have higher average total purchases than male players. 

3. Based on the analysis on the items sold, the *most popular items* and the *most profitable items* are very similar. In fact, the top 3 most popular items are also the top 3 most profitable items. Hence, the result tells that Heroes of Pymoli has been introducing the correct items-for-sale (good selling strategies!)
